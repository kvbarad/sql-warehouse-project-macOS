# Data Layering:
Utilizes gold and silver schemas which implies structured layers for curated (gold) and cleansed/staging (silver) data.
Sampling for Validation:
Using TOP 1000 selects to quickly verify data in key tables for sanity checks.
Metadata Exploration:
Querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA views to understand schema structure and data dictionary without assumptions.
Dimension Exploration:
Uses DISTINCT to identify unique values for dimensions like country, category, and product name.
Sorted results present data hierarchically by category/subcategory/product.
Date Range Analysis:
Uses MIN, MAX, and DATEDIFF to assess the period coverage of order dates and customer birthdates.
Conversion of birthdates to age is done using current system date.
Sales Measures:
Counts, sums, and averages provide fundamental business metrics:
Total quantity sold,
Average price,
Total orders and distinct orders,
Counts of products and customers.
Both raw counts and distinct counts used appropriately (e.g., distinct orders).
Business Summary Report:
Uses UNION ALL to concatenate separate metrics in one query output — each row indicating a particular metric.
Magnitude Analyses:
Aggregates on dimensions like country, gender, category to understand distributions.
Revenue calculations by customer, category, and country reveal business health drivers.
Ranking Analysis:
Applies TOP N and window functions (ROW_NUMBER()) to identify best and worst revenue-generating products.
Use of windowing is designed for scaling to large datasets.
Joins:
Left joins ensure no loss of sales or customers even if dimension data is missing.
3. Explanations on How the Query Works
Explanation
Schema Selection:
The script assumes connection to the DataWarehouse database, a multi-schema warehouse environment.
Top Row Checks:
The initial TOP 1000 selects give quick access to random subsets from both core (gold) analytic tables and upstream cleaned data (silver) for visual validation during learning.
Schema Structure Discovery:
Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA, the query reveals database metadata, helping users learn how tables and columns are organized.
Dimension Data Exploration:
Distinct values of key categorical fields like country, category, etc., are retrieved to identify the scope and cardinality of dimension attributes.
Date Ranges and Age Calculation:
Minimum and maximum dates from fact and dimension tables are found, with difference computations in years/months/days to grasp data period coverage. Customer ages are estimated by subtracting birth dates from the current date.
Measures and Counts:
Multiple aggregate queries retrieve the business’s primary KPIs: total quantities, sales amounts, average sale prices, counts of unique orders, products, and customers.
Consolidated KPI Report:
UNION ALL combines the key metrics vertically into a two-column result for easy review or export into BI tools.
Category & Demographic Aggregation:
Grouping by dimension (country, gender, product category) and aggregation of counts or sums help analyze business scale and focus sectors.
Revenue By Customer:
Joins between sales fact and customer dimension allow attributing revenue to customer identities, both keyed and named.
Ranking:
Uses TOP clauses and window functions (ROW_NUMBER() OVER) to rank products by sales, usable to filter and extract top performers or laggards.
